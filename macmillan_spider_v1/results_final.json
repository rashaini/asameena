Call us free* 0808 808 00 00 Monday to Friday, 9am-8pm The information and support section of our website has recently changed and we'd love to know what you think - let us know by email or answer these 10 questions in our short survey.What has changed?We've rearranged our information so that information and support are together. This makes sense as somebody searching for information about their cancer or treatment would logically also be interested in ways that Macmillan can help them.We've also structured our cancer information in a new way. Lots of people told us that they prefer to digest information at their own pace rather than be faced with it all at once. For this reason we've created a tiered information structure, with an introduction followed by more in-depth information further down the page for those who want it.Macmillan recently developed our brand to include more photography, different colours and a focus on real-life stories. We've tried to reflect this in this new section and we hope that the inclusion of more real people and their experiences makes our content more accessible to more people.Why the new design?The pages have been redesigned to be easy to browse and to help you get what you\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re also launching our new homepage which reflects the updated site structure and brand refresh.Why has it changed?We've done a lot of user research, both within Macmillan and by engaging directly with our audience. We have an in-house user-experience specialist, who's been testing new approaches to see what works best for our users. When we were testing our cancer information content, we found that some people wanted loads of detail, while others were completely overwhelmed by longer articles, so we've developed a whole new tiered system of delivering this sort of content. This way, you can browse at a level of detail you\u2019re comfortable with.We\u2019re also moving to a new content management system which will allow us to maintain the high standard of our information more easily.Is there a mobile version?Yes. All of our new sections are optimised for mobile and tablet.Why does some content look different?We have a huge amount of content and we\u2019re moving it to our new website section by section. This means that there will be a time where some content is on our new system and some is still on the old one. At the moment around 60% of all of our content is in the new format, but we\u2019re working on it. And the content on the older pages is still fully quality assured and up-to-date, it just won\u2019t look so pretty or work so well on your mobile.Is anything else changing?We\u2019ll be updating the rest of the site over the next year \u2013 we\u2019ll keep you updated.I can't find what I'm looking for?If you\u2019re having problems finding cancer information, then please contact the Macmillan Support Line on 0808 808 0000. Reviewed: 10 Dec 2014 Next review: 2015 How we write our information and the sources we use Tell us what you think about our new website Back to Understanding What is cancer? There are more than 200 different kinds of cancer, each with its own name and treatment. Cancer and cell types Cancers are grouped into types. Types of cancer often behave and respond to treatments in different ways. Cancer symptoms Know the common risks, signs and symptoms of cancer. Getting diagnosed If you have any unusual symptoms or changes to your body that are worrying you, go and see your GP. Symptoms and common cancers The most common cancers among men and women in the UK are lung, large bowel, prostate, bladder, breast and ovarian. How is cancer treated? There are five main types of cancer treatment. You may receive one, or a combination of treatments, depending on your cancer type. Why do cancers come back? Sometimes, tiny cancer cells are left behind after cancer treatment. These can divide to form a new tumour.

Call us free* 0808 808 00 00 Monday to Friday, 9am-8pm 'I didn't understand before how warm a virtual hug can be.' When Daloni was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of womb cancer, she had lots of questions about this type of cancer, as well as what to expect from the treatment. When she came across Macmillan's Online Community, she found answers from a warm and welcoming group, who had first-hand experience of all that lay ahead. Daloni's story I was researching online how I was going to feel, what my experience would be like, and I came across the Macmillan Online Community. I joined the womb cancer support group there. The difference between the Online Community and the advice you receive from healthcare professionals is that these are lived experiences \u2013 these are people who have been there, done that and know exactly how you feel. They could tell me that there was going to be a pattern to this, that that there were some things that I could do to plan my life. Suddenly I saw that my life didn\u2019t need to be completely out of control. As you can imagine there are some fairly difficult treatments that we have to go through, and some fairly difficult surgeries and examinations. These are things that are really difficult to talk about, but we could talk about absolutely about anything. You can only talk to women about women things. You know, you don\u2019t talk to your partner about your smear test. You talk to your girlfriends about it. We talk about intimate things that it\u2019s almost impossible to talk about with someone who isn\u2019t going through this. I found women who had gone through very similar experiences to me and were now two years down the line saying 'I'm alive.' It was like a huge weight had been taken off my shoulders to discover these women out there living normal lives, who had got back to living life, at a time when I was really very frightened about the future. We all know that aspects of this are difficult. We all know that there are aspects that we simply don't want to do, but we need to, and we encourage each other and look after each other. I really didn\u2019t understand before how warm and embracing a virtual hug can be. You might think it would be better to have someone there giving you a cuddle, but the reality is that the people who really understand you are all over the country. They\u2019re in rural Scotland, at the bottom of Cornwall, in the middle of Manchester. The Online Community is very well supported. It has clear guidelines and very effective moderation, and it\u2019s run by a group of people who live and breathe it and make sure it's a safe place. Fear can happen at any time of day. I think the thing about fear is it happens at any time of day and it particularly happens at night. One of the really great things about the Online Community is that there\u2019s always somebody there, 24/7. I never imagined I\u2019d find this level of support on the internet. I was a little bit skeptical before I started and now I am a complete convert. It\u2019s become clear to me over the last couple of years just what the Community means to people. It\u2019s a place where we can share our experiences. Where nobody judges us. We don\u2019t have to preface things \u2013 we can assume that people understand because we all know what it\u2019s like. We all know how frightening it is. We know how undignified it can be. Sometimes all you need to do is say 'I\u2019m scared,' and sometimes that\u2019s really hard to say to family and friends because they are scared for you. The piece of shared experience that was most useful for me was somebody with a very similar diagnosis, saying 'I\u2019m still here,' three years on.It was like sitting in the dark and the light came on.

We demand better Whatever we do, we always believe there\u2019s room for improvement. So we demand better \u2013 from ourselves and others.

First diagnosed nearly 8 years ago. He has undergone radiotherapy twice and chemo for 10 sessions. The cancer has now spread again and there is talk of perhaps Radium223 being used to assist. He had a recent admission to hospital as he had terrible back and hip pain. We are seeing the Oncologist tomorrow. He has had enzalutamide which hasn't worked effectively. Prior to that he was in a trial and had to come out of it. \u00a0Anyone out there with similar experience? It would be useful to know what treatments seem to work.

Cancer Talk Week \u2013 why should we talk about cancer? 29 Jan 2016 2:27 PM by Matthew - Macmillan Comments 2 It's Cancer Talk Week and, in our latest blog, our editor Imogen talks about her experience as a Macmillan support line volunteer, highlights the benefits of talking about cancer and looks at some of the different ways people can start talking... One evening each week, I stop being an editor and start acting as a frontline volunteer. I began taking calls on the Macmillan support line (MSL) over a year ago and it\u2019s been a great experience in many ways. Most importantly, it\u2019s helped me understand how hard it can be to talk about cancer. Even on the support line, callers are often hesitant to begin that conversation \u2013 and many people may not call at all. That\u2019s why we\u2019re using Cancer Talk Week to open up about the loneliness that can follow a cancer diagnosis and explore why it\u2019s so hard to talk honestly about it. Why is it hard to talk about cancer? Many of us don\u2019t like talking about our problems because we don\u2019t want to seem needy or may want to protect other people from being upset. We may think that our problems aren\u2019t important enough to bother people with. But in reality many people will want to help. Why should we try to talk about cancer? Talking can have many benefits. Whether you have cancer or you\u2019re a friend or relative of someone with cancer, putting your fears or concerns into words can help you make sense of difficult situations. Talking about cancer may help you: feel more in control feel less anxious make important decisions realise that your feelings are normal stop your fears growing bigger feel valued and supported. It can also bring you closer together at a difficult time. Our information can help you start those conversations. If you have cancer Our free booklet Talking about cancer has tips and advice about starting conversations and sharing your feelings with family, friends and health professionals. If you\u2019d feel more comfortable talking to someone outside of your family or group of friends, give one of our cancer support specialists a call on 0808 808 00 00. Or, you could use our Online Community to talk about your thoughts and feelings with people who know what you\u2019re going through. Some people don\u2019t want to share their feelings about cancer or its treatment. Be open with your friends and family when it\u2019s hard to talk. Sometimes you may want to enjoy not talking about the cancer. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell people when you would prefer to talk about other things. If you\u2019re a friend or relative Just being there for someone with cancer is often the most important thing. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not sure what to say \u2013 listening is just as useful. We have more information about how talking and listening can help your loved one. Our free booklet Lost for words \u2013 how to talk to someone with cancer can help you better understand how your friend or relative may be feeling. It also includes a practical checklist of ways you can help. Remember, our support line and Online Community are there for you too. Being close to someone who has cancer can feel just as isolating. You may feel guilty for being upset or try to hide how you feel to stay strong for your loved one. But your feelings are valid and we want to offer you the same support.

Call us free* 0808 808 00 00 Monday to Friday, 9am-8pm 'Macmillan's information was completely invaluable for us.' Amrik used our online information and our free booklets to help him and his family know what to expect, when he was diagnosed with\u00a0Hodgkin lymphoma.\u00a0He says without it, they'd have been a lot more scared and anxious about what lay ahead. Amrik's story The first leaflet I read was a Macmillan one, which was just purely about what to expect. It was such a straight-talking document about what\u2019s going to happen and how you can get through it. I think that was one of the main things I based my recovery on, in terms of knowing what to expect, and how to react around friends and things like that. I was really concerned about losing my hair\u00a0and that sort of thing. Thankfully the booklet put me completely at ease.\u00a0I know my mother used the Macmillan website a lot because for a long time we didn't know what the side effects would be. So it was really important for mum to be prepared for anything. We didn't want any surprises at this stage. We were done with nasty surprises after the diagnosis.The information that\u2019s available from Macmillan, whether it\u2019s online or in physical leaflets, is invaluable. If Macmillan hadn't been there, it would have like been like going into a dark tunnel blind. I wouldn\u2019t have known what to expect. And my friends wouldn\u2019t have known how to approach the whole situation either. I think putting everyone at ease at such a difficult time is so important.I know my family were really informed thanks to Macmillan. Their information was priceless to us and still is, really.

Have a browse through the Your Event pack or Macmillan's Little Book of 101 Big Ideas for inspiration.Holding a raffle? That\u2019s fine, as long as the tickets are sold and drawn on the same day. If the tickets are sold before the day of the raffle then you\u2019ll need to obtain a lottery licence from your local authority. Call the Fundraising Support Centre for more information and advice.When's the best time?Choose a date that is best for you and your friends and colleagues and remember that you will need plenty of time to organise it (it might take longer than you think). Try to avoid competition by avoiding clashes with similar events nearby.Where\u2019s the best place?Choose a venue that\u2019s large enough and has all the amenities you\u2019ll need. If you\u2019d like to sell alcohol or have live music, make sure the venue has the necessary licences (find out more in top tip number 5 \u2013 It'll be alright on the night).

Include all the costs you expect to incur (promotion, equipment, etc) and estimate how much money will come in (tickets, sponsorship, etc).Can you reduce your costs?

Rather than enjoying a seaside stroll, Kevin and Rachel were struggling with their health. Rachel and Kevin both diagnosed with cancer.They didn\u2019t know how unwell they were going to be, or whether they would be well enough to look after one another, but fortunately the day Kevin was diagnosed he met Charlotte, his Macmillan Nurse.

Call us free* 0808 808 00 00 Monday to Friday, 9am-8pm 'I want to give patients the very best care and attention that I possibly can.' Karen is a Macmillan consultant radiographer at Musgrove Park Hospital in Somerset, providing support to people with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.\u00a0She says that radiotherapy can be a very daunting experience, so having someone there who can explain the treatment and its potential side effects is important. Karen's story I tend to support patients during radiotherapy and afterwards as well, with late side effects that may occur as a consequence of cancer treatment. I\u2019m their main point of contact. Radiotherapy can be a very daunting experience, so having someone there who can explain the treatment and its potential side effects, in a way that people can understand, is very important.\u00a0Radiotherapy is a very technically driven treatment and we need to make sure that patients and their relatives and friends understand exactly what they\u2019re going through. We have an open evening here at the radiotherapy department once a month, where patients and their relatives can come and have a look around the treatment rooms and talk to some of the staff about some of their anxieties and fears. It really helps.Patients have to be in the treatment room on their own for radiotherapy. We\u2019re watching all the time on our TV cameras. It can be quite a claustrophobic experience and one of my roles is really to help patients overcome that fear and anxiety.Information is usually put together based on patients\u2019 needs. We don\u2019t try to bombard them with every single leaflet in the rack, but we tailor information accordingly to every individual patient.Patients often feel very anxious about coming in for treatment, radiotherapy in particular, as they don\u2019t always fully understand what\u2019s going to happen. For a lot of patients, it\u2019s their first experience here. A lot of patients feel anger, confusion and distress. I try to help them overcome those emotions and support them throughout the process.Side effects can occur in any part of the body \u2013 it depends on the area that we treat. With head and neck radiotherapy patients, they can suffer some quite nasty mouth ulcers, making swallowing, eating and communicating very difficult.I think there are a lot of misconceptions about radiotherapy. There are certainly a lot of scare stories. In the early years, radiotherapy caused some quite severe side effects and we didn\u2019t know an awful lot about those and how to manage them. Our treatments are much more tailor-made now to reduce or minimise radiotherapy reactions.Macmillan cares very passionately about the patient experience and that sits in complete harmony with my own thoughts and feelings. I want to give patients the very best care and attention that I possibly can, and Macmillan helps me provide that care.

Call us free* 0808 808 00 00 Monday to Friday, 9am-8pm 'I was taking control of the situation and it felt really good.' Sara was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2014. Her treatment meant she lost her hair, a concept that she found hard to deal with at first. But Sara decided to make this into a positive. She began taking pictures of herself wearing a different hat every day and shared them online. She now has a huge social media following and has raised more than \u00a314,000 for Macmillan. Sara's story I have always had long, thick, blonde hair and I found the idea of losing it really horrendous. I was so scared of it. I think it's an important thing for your identity. Then I realised that this was going to happen anyway so I decided to do something positive about it. I decided at first that I would try some crazy hairstyles and have a different one most days. So I went to the hairdressers and asked for one of those undercuts and had one whole side of my hair shaved. Then I actually ended up with a Mohawk after that. I was taking control of the situation and it felt really good. I could also try out those hairstyles that I would have never considered. I enjoyed it. Then I realised that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do the hair thing for long, as it was all actually starting to fall out. So I wanted to raise money for Macmillan to show my gratitude and decided to wear a new hat or headgear every day of my treatment. Things just snowballed from there. I have met some wonderful people and the online reaction has been amazing. I keep getting sent hats and have raised more than \u00a314,000. When I told my oncologist about it, he asked if this was a displacement exercise and I suppose it is in many ways. I was worried about the loss of my hair so I have taken control of it and am enjoying it. Of course I still have down days and I don\u2019t like the way it looks sometimes. I can feel like I look like an alien. I didn\u2019t want to wear a wig because I thought that seemed dishonest in a way. I am not ashamed of how I look. That\u2019s who I am. I have never wanted the sympathy vote or the feeling that people were feeling sorry for me. I keep that out of it. I want to show positivity in the face of it.
